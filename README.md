# Path-Finder-Visualizer
Developed a pathfinding visualizer using algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's. Allowed users to control the grid structure, block distribution, and source-destination positions. Implemented fast and slow visualizers to determine the minimum steps required to reach the target."
